## Summary
As you can see from the analysis, this scrpit provides a simple and efficient way for an election commission to audit election results. With a few minor tweaks, this script can be used to analyze any election results. Obviously, all datasets for election results will not be exactly the same. The modifications that may have to be to be done would be:
- changing column references to match the formatting of new datasets
- naming conventions may have to be changed to match the type of election. For example, we could be using this model for city level elections that would need breakdowns by precinct instead of by county.
